Copy Paste the contents of Hosts file to your local machine Hosts file located at (Windows)- C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\Hosts

To check if your system accepted the changes- run 'ipconfig /displaydns' command in cmd, without quotes:P, and you will see the added servers pointed to 0.0.0.0
Also when you open any site to validate the hack, press ctrl+shift+i and go to console tab. Here you will find many errors and warnings about 400 errCode.

If this does work try-
  1) rebooting the system.
  2) run 'ipconfig /flushdns' in cmd.
  3) clearing the browser cache.

This will block most (but not all) of the google and youTube ads (not other ad servers though).

ps- if you find any other ad server you know what to do
